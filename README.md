## Hi, I'm Anh 👋

I'm a Computer Science student with a strong interest in data analysis, software development, and applying technology to real-world problems.

I work primarily with **Python, SQL, and C++**, and I enjoy building projects that involve data cleaning, automation, and exploratory analysis. Some of my work focuses on transforming raw data into meaningful insights and building practical tools that improve workflows.

I'm especially interested in:
- Data analytics & visualization
- Machine learning fundamentals
- Healthcare & social-impact applications
- Writing clean, reliable, and maintainable code

Currently, I'm focused on expanding my technical skills through hands-on projects and research opportunities, and I'm always open to learning new tools and technologies.
